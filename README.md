This model was trained on colposcopic pictures of the Scientific Center for Family Health and Human Reproduction, which is located in Irkutsk, Russia.

For training, 1053 images with a size of 512 * 512 pixels were used.

Training parameters: StyleGAN v3, seed=700; gamma=10; cfg=stylegan2; batch=8.

GPU: Gforce GTX 2080Ti 11Gb VRAM

Verification of the diagnoses of patients whose images were used to train this model was not carried out.
The work was performed for presentation at the VIII scientific-practical conference with
international participation "Fundamental and applied aspects of reproductive medicine" December 24-25, 2021 in Irkutsk.
